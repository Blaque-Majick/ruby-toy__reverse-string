# Toy Problem - Ruby

## Reverse String

### Objectives

1. Practice thinking through abstract algorithms.
2. Properly use common data structures.

### Part 1 - Reverse the characters in a string.

Write an algorithm that reverses the order of all of a given string's characters.

For example, the algorithm would take `"Today is a good day"` and return `"yad doog a si yadoT"`.

Note: Do not use the `.reverse` method.

### Part 2 - Reverse the words in a string.

Write an algorithm that reverses the order of the words in a given string but retains the order of each word's characters.

For example, the algorithm would take `"Today is a good day"` and return `"day good a is Today"`.
